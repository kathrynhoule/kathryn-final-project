## User Stories ##
### Main User ###
As a trading card collector, I want to be able to see what products are available for purchase for specific franchises so that I can take advantage of purchasing opportunities to acquire rare, favourable, or old collectibles before they become unavailable.

### Admin ###
As a seller, I want the ability to view analytics on user requests and past user purchases, so that I can effectively identify trending cards and proactively offer products to meet user demand.
