## User Stories ##
### Main User ###
As a trading card collector, I want to be able to see what products are available for purchase for certain franchises and when they came out. 

### Admin ###
As a seller, I want to be able to understand what products are most appealing to buyers, based on things like series and year of release, and allow people to submit requests for things they'd like to see.
